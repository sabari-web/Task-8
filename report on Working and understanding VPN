 Working and understanding¬†VPN

Objective:
Understand how VPNs protect privacy and encrypt communication.

üõ† Tools & Requirements
- OS: Kali Linux 
- Tool: [`kalitorify`](https://github.com/brainfucksec/kalitorify)
- Dependencies: `tor`, `iptables`, `scrot` (for screenshots)
- Websites used for verification:

  - [https://dnsleaktest.com](https://dnsleaktest.com)

## üì• Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone Kalitorify
git clone https://github.com/brainfucksec/kalitorify.git
cd kalitorify
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y tor
chmod +x kalitorify.sh
sudo ./kalitorify.sh --tor

Verification

 DNS Leak Test
Visited https://dnsleaktest.com

Result: No DNS leak. DNS server shown was from the Tor network, not ISP. ‚úîÔ∏è
| Feature             | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Full anonymity      | Routes all traffic (not just browser) through Tor |
| DNS leak protection | Ensures DNS requests go through Tor DNSPort       |
| Easy toggle         | Start/stop Tor routing via simple CLI             |
| Lightweight         | Works without heavy VPN or browser extensions     |


‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Internet speed is slower due to Tor routing

Some websites block Tor exit nodes

Not a substitute for commercial VPNs when speed is needed

 Disconnect VPN

kalitorify --clearnet

Re-check IP at https://dnsleaktest.com

Note the difference.

Research: VPN Features in Kalitorify
It provides VPN-like privacy and security features by routing all Kali Linux traffic through the Tor network using a transparent proxy setup.
| Feature                           | Description                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **IP Masking**                  | Hides real IP address by routing traffic through Tor exit nodes           |
| ‚úÖ **DNS Leak Protection**         | Uses Tor‚Äôs built-in DNS server (`DNSPort`) to prevent DNS leaks           |
| ‚úÖ **System-wide Traffic Routing** | Redirects all network traffic (not just browser) through Tor              |
| ‚úÖ **Encryption**                  | Traffic is encrypted through the Tor network during transit               |
| ‚úÖ **Bypass Censorship**           | Can access blocked content and .onion websites                            |
| ‚úÖ **No Logs**                     | Tor is decentralized and doesn‚Äôt log your traffic like some VPN providers |

 Typical Impact on Browsing Speed:

| Connection Type | Speed             | Security            | When to Use                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal          | Fastest           | Minimal             | Everyday casual browsing                           |
| VPN             | Slower (variable) | Encrypted & private | When privacy, anonymity, or geo-spoofing is needed |
